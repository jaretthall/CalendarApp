# Development Environment 

- Set up the development environment 

- Install Node.js, Git, and any required global packages 

- Create a new repository for the project 

- Set up a basic project structure with directories for frontend, backend, config, tests, and docs 

# Application Architecture 

- Design the application architecture 

- Use React for the frontend to build reusable UI components 

- Use Express.js for the backend API to handle data management and business logic 

- Select Azure Cosmos DB for the database to support multi-region replication and scalability 

- Use Azure Blob Storage for storing and serving the design assets and user-uploaded files 

- Implement Azure AD B2C for user authentication and authorization management 

# Data Models 

- Design the data models 

- Create a "Location" model to represent the two supported locations 

- Create a "Shift" model to represent a provider's shift, associated with a location and date 

- Create a "Provider" model to represent a healthcare provider, with fields for name and initials 

- Create a "User" model to represent application users, with fields for name, email, and role 

# Backend API 

- Implement the backend API 

- Build CRUD endpoints for locations, shifts, providers, and users 

- Implement business logic for creating and updating shifts, handling overlaps and conflicts 

- Integrate with Azure AD B2C for user authentication and authorization 

- Implement role-based access control to restrict edit access to admin users 

- Set up API routes and controllers to handle incoming requests and return responses 

# Frontend UI Components 

- Build the frontend UI components 

- Create a reusable "Calendar" component that supports month and week views 

- Implement logic to fetch and display shifts from the API, grouped by location 

- Add support for split and combined location views in the calendar 

- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for creating and editing shifts 

- Create a "DayCell" component to render shifts and vacation indicators for a given day 

- Build a "ProviderInitials" component to display provider initials in a shift slot 

- Create an "AdminSettings" component for managing locations, providers, and users 

# Data Synchronization 

- Implement data synchronization 

- Use Azure Cosmos DB's change feed to track updates to shifts and locations 

- Implement real-time updates to the calendar when changes are made by other users 

- Use optimistic concurrency control to handle conflicts and ensure data consistency 

- Implement offline support by caching data locally and syncing when a connection is available 

# Authentication and Authorization 

- Integrate authentication and authorization 

- Add login and registration flows using Azure AD B2C 

- Implement token-based authentication for API requests 

- Add role-based access control to restrict edit functionality to admin users 

- Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page 

- Display appropriate error messages for unauthorized access attempts 

# Testing and Debugging 

- Test and debug 

- Write unit tests for backend API routes and data models 

- Write integration tests for frontend components and user flows 

- Conduct manual testing of all application features and edge cases 

- Test the application across multiple devices and screen sizes 

- Debug and fix any issues uncovered during testing 

# Deployment and Documentation 

- Deploy and document 

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps to automate builds and deployments 

- Configure Azure App Service to host the backend API 

- Use Azure Storage to host the static frontend files 

- Set up Azure Monitor to collect logs and metrics for application health and performance 

- Write user guides and onboarding documentation, including how to access the application and manage shifts 

- Produce technical documentation outlining the application architecture, data models, and deployment process 

- Conduct user acceptance testing and address any feedback or issues 

- Deploy the application to production and monitor for errors and performance issues 

# Future Enhancements 

- Plan for future enhancements 

- Implement email and SMS notifications for shift reminders and updates 

- Add support for importing and exporting shift data in CSV format 

- Integrate with external calendar systems like Google Calendar and Outlook 

- Implement a reporting dashboard for visualizing shift coverage and utilization metrics 

- Conduct regular user feedback sessions to gather input for new features and improvements 

By following this plan and leveraging the specified technologies and services, I can recreate a fully functional version of the providerSchedule application that meets all the requirements around calendar management, user access control, data synchronization, and user experience. The key aspects I've focused on are: 

- Building a scalable and flexible architecture using React, Express.js, and Azure services 

- Designing data models that support the core shift scheduling and location management features 

- Implementing a user-friendly calendar interface with support for split and combined location views 

- Ensuring secure and role-based access to application features and data 

- Enabling real-time data synchronization across devices for a seamless user experience 

- Providing thorough testing, deployment, and documentation to ensure a stable and maintainable application 

With this foundation in place, the application can be easily extended and enhanced over time to meet evolving business needs and user requirements.
